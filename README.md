# To-Do Web Application

A full-stack To-Do Web Application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently and boost productivity. This application goes beyond a simple list by offering advanced features such as user authentication, task prioritization, recurring tasks, and detailed analytics.

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
* **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login system to provide a personalized experience for each user.
* **Task Management:** Easily create, edit, and delete tasks.
* **List Organization:** Categorize tasks into custom lists (e.g., "Work," "Personal," "Shopping").
* **Task Completion:** Mark tasks as completed to track progress.
* **Date & Time Setting:** Assign due dates and specific times to tasks for better scheduling.

### Advanced Features
* **Task Prioritization:** Assign priority levels (High, Medium, Low) to tasks.
* **Recurring Tasks:** Set up tasks that repeat daily, weekly, or monthly.
* **Notifications & Reminders:** Get timely alerts for upcoming or overdue tasks.
* **Search & Filtering:** Quickly find tasks using a search bar and filter them by due date, priority, or status.
* **Progress Analytics:** View a dashboard with visual representations of your task completion rate over time.
* **Subtasks/Checklists:** Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.
* **Tagging System:** Use custom tags (e.g., `#urgent`, `#project_X`) for flexible organization.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Frontend
* **React.js:** For building the user interface.
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structuring and styling the web pages.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For client-side logic.
* **State Management:** (e.g., React Context, Redux, or Zustand)
* **Routing:** (e.g., React Router)

### Backend
* **Node.js:** The runtime environment for the server.
* **Express.js:** The web framework for building the API.
* **Database:** (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL)
* **Authentication:** (e.g., JWT - JSON Web Tokens)
* **Password Hashing:** (e.g., bcrypt.js)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* A database (e.g., MongoDB)

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd to-do-web-app
    ```
2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory.
    * Copy the contents of `.env.example` and fill in your details (e.g., database URI, JWT secret key).
3.  **Install dependencies for the backend:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies for the frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm start
    ```
    The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` (or the port you specify).
2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000` and automatically open in your browser.
